	<h1>Bauhaus.</h1>
	<div class="firstparagraph">
		<p id="onep">The Bauhaus school was founded in Weimar by German architect Walter Gropius in 1919. At the time, Europe was experiencing huge changes socially and politically, as well as technologically.</p>
		<br>
		<p id="twop">The Bauhaus school didn’t shy away from the impact of change, but instead embraced it. Students were taught to embrace modern technologies in order to succeed in a modern environment.</p>
		<br>
		<p id="threep">‘Form follows function’ was the key teaching of the Bauhaus, and this was applied in the school’s approach to graphic design and typography, as well as architecture.</p>
		<p id="fourp">Design teachers like Herbert Bayer and Paul Klee emphasised a basics-first approach to design, breaking down and analysing the fundamentals of color, type and layout.</p>

		<h2>100 years of bauhaus</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="secondparagraph">
		<p>2019 marks the centenary of the Bauhaus, the famous German art school which developed and championed a distinct and highly influential brand of modernist design across a wide range of disciplines, including architecture, interior design,
			typography, and graphic design.</p>
		<br>
		<p id="longp">Bauhaus design’s impact on today’s graphics is hard to overestimate. Associated with primary colors, thick straight lines slashing across white space, and that emphatically modern trilogy of circle, triangle and square.</p>
		<p id="endp">A break with traditional ideas and old ways of life, and a new way of thinking in art, architecture, education and society: when Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in 1919, he established a school of design which still inspires
		today. In keeping with its motto ‘Thinking the World Anew’, the Bauhaus Association 2019 will join regional, national and international partners in facilitating a rediscovery of the Bauhaus heritage and its present and future
		significance.</p>

		<p id="longpp">“You can see the working process in Bayer’s large (almost 15 x 24”) specimen of Universal, his famous single-case, geometrically derived typeface: there’s the indent of the compass used to construct the letterforms, the broad
			strokes in gouache, and the collaged corrections to the ‘g’ and ‘k’ (his handwritten legend indicates that these are ‘not yet finished’).
			“The oversize red ‘d,’ a readymade logo on its own, is called out for its ‘precise optical effects.’ Yet formal purity did not always produce legibility, as is clear from some of the more awkward letters. Bayer iterated on Universal for
			five years, though it was never put into a production.”</p>
		<br>
		<p id="endpp">Bauhaus typographers designed type with a particular purpose in mind—to create functional fonts which could be used universally across print media and signage. However, many of the typefaces designed by Bauhaus teachers and
			students were experimental, with some never completed or published. Now, modern-day designers are reviving or reinterpreting Bauhaus typefaces for the digital era.</p>
